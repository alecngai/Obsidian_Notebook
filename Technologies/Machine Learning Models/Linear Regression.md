## Supervised Learning 

**Regression**: The output variable to be predicted is continuous in nature, e.g. scores of a studen, diamond prices, etc. 

**Classification**: The output variable to be predicted is categorical in nature, e.g. classifying incoming emails as spam or ham, Yes or No, True or False, 0 or 1. 

## Unspervised Learning 
**Clustering**: No predefined labesl are assigned to groups/clusters formed, e.g. customer segmentation. Linear Regression is a supeervised Learning algorithm in the machine learning that supports finding the linear correlation among variables. The result or output of the regression problem is a real or continous value. 

## Simple Linear Regression 

Linear regression shows the relation between independent (Predictor) variable i.e. X-axis and the dependent (output) variable i.e. Y-axis. 

Linear regression is called **simple linear regression** when there is only a single input variable and single output.

The above graph presents the linear relation between the output(Y) variables and predictor(X) variables. The blue line is referred to as the best fit straight line. Based on the given data points, we attempt to plot aline that fits the points best. This line is created using a training set, and can be used to predict future values based on a test set of predictors. 

To calculate the best fit line linear regression uses astraditional slope-intercerpt form which is **Yi = B0 + B1Xi**
