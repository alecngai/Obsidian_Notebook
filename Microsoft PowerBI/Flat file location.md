-   **Local** - You can import data from a local file into Power BI. The file isn't moved into Power BI, and a link doesn't remain to it. Instead, a new dataset is created in Power BI, and data from the [[Excel]] file is loaded into it. Accordingly, changes to the original [[Excel]] file are not reflected in your Power BI dataset. You can use local data import for data that doesn't change.
    
-   **OneDrive for Business** - You can pull data from OneDrive for Business into Power BI. This method is effective in keeping an [[Excel]] file and your dataset, reports, and dashboards in Power BI synchronized. Power BI connects regularly to your file on OneDrive. If any changes are found, your dataset, reports, and dashboards are automatically updated in Power BI.
    
-   **OneDrive - Personal** - You can use data from files on a personal OneDrive account, and get many of the same benefits that you would with OneDrive for Business. However, you'll need to sign in with your personal OneDrive account, and select the **Keep me signed in** option. Check with your system administrator to determine whether this type of connection is allowed in your organization.
    
-   **SharePoint - Team Sites** - Saving your Power BI Desktop files to SharePoint Team Sites is similar to saving to OneDrive for Business. The main difference is how you connect to the file from Power BI. You can specify a URL or connect to the root folder.
