### Discrete Versus Continuous

The difference between a green or blue pill

Green is **continuous / measure** , i.e. SUM(Profit) is a range, therefore it's a continuous axis

Blue is **discontinuous / dimension** , i.e. Category, which contains a finite number of degrees

Another difference is continuous filter has a range, while discontinuous has check list filter

### Rows and Columns
Adding a blue pill to rows or columns will always result in headers,  Row produces headers on the left, while columns produces headers on the top.

If you add continuous pill to the data, it will fill the value within the axis. 

If you add continuous pill to the row, it will add an axis. 

**Bar Chart** is a measure of a discontinuous axis and a continuous axis 

**Scatter Plot** is a measure between two continuous pills. You must then assign a discontinuous pill into detail to show the difference between the two. 

If you hover over show me section of Tableau, it will show the user how many measures you need vs Dimensions. 

### Filters
To use filters, you must drop a pill onto filters. 

measures will prdouce a range filter, dimensions a checklist

### Colors
Drag a pill that is already in row or column and drag onto colors, this will auto assign color to the data  

Avoid using too many colors, it can be confusing to the viewers

measures will produce a range of shades, dimensions will produce individually colors, which you can adjust within the color schema.  

Red and green are bad for color blind, blue and orange are better, just make sure to include the legend and this is good for showing negative as orange, and postive as blue

### Dates
**Discontinuous Filter**

Allows you to sort by discrete date


**Continuous Filter**
#### Relative Dates
This allows you to select a period to filter the data, 

#### Range of Dates
Allows you to produce a slider bar which shows a range of dates which is a continuous filter.
