Machine learning is excellent for:

- Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better than a traditional approach
- Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solution: the best Machine Learning techniques can perhaps find a solution
- Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data
- Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.
